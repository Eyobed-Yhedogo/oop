Notice how we’ve written @property above a function called house. Doing so defines house as a property of our class. With house as a property, we gain the ability to define how some attribute of our class, _house, should be set and retrieved. Indeed, we can now define a function called a “setter”, via @house.setter, which will be called whenever the house property is set—for example, with student.house = "Gryffindor". Here, we’ve made our setter validate values of house for us. Notice how we raise a ValueError if the value of house is not any of the Harry Potter houses, otherwise, we’ll use house to update the value of _house. Why _house and not house? house is a property of our class, with functions via which a user attempts to set our class attribute. _house is that class attribute itself. The leading underscore, _, indicates to users they need not (and indeed, shouldn’t!) modify this value directly. _house should only be set through the house setter. Notice how the house property simply returns that value of _house, our class attribute that has presumably been validated using our house setter. When a user calls student.house, they’re getting the value of _house through our house “getter”.

In addition to the name of the house, we can protect the name of our student as well. Modify your code as follows:
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, house):
        self.name = name
        self.house = house

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.name} from {self.house}"

    # Getter for name
    @property
    def name(self):
        return self._name

    # Setter for name
    @name.setter
    def name(self, name):
        if not name:
            raise ValueError("Invalid name")
        self._name = name

    @property
    def house(self):
        return self._house

    @house.setter
    def house(self, house):
        if house not in ["Gryffindor", "Hufflepuff", "Ravenclaw", "Slytherin"]:
            raise ValueError("Invalid house")
        self._house = house


def main():
    student = get_student()
    print(student)


def get_student():
    name = input("Name: ")
    house = input("House: ")
    return Student(name, house)
